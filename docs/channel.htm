<h1>Channel</h1>
<p>This is a channel. Each channel has a list of clients and a method that can send the same thing to every client in a loop.<br>
It actually has two, and they're very similar to each other. The difference is that send() sends to everyone in the channel, while say() sends to everyone except the client who caused the message to be sent in the first place.</p>
